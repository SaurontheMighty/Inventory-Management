Designed as a basic back-end software for use in a store like environment all we had to do was make a system that could add remove, and edit items but I was having a lot of fun so I added a shopping cart and a bunch of other features. In fact the one which we were supposed to make for the assignment couldn't even save changes, so I added stock.txt which the file loads information from and writes information to it after the program finishes running.
